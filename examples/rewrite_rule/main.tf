#----------Testing Use Case  -------------
# Application Gateway routing traffic from your application. 
# Assume that your Application runing the scale set contains two virtual machine instances. 
# The scale set is added to the default backend pool need to updated with IP or FQDN of the application gateway.
# The example input from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/tutorial-manage-web-traffic-cli
