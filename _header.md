# Azure Application Gateway Terraform Module

Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer that enables you to manage and optimize the traffic to your web applications. When using Terraform to deploy Azure resources, you can make use of a Terraform module to define and configure the Azure Application Gateway. Here is a summary page about using an Azure Application Gateway Terraform module:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.
>
> All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.
>
> However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## What is Azure Application Gateway?

Azure Application Gateway is a Layer-7 load balancer service provided by Microsoft Azure. It enables you to manage traffic to your web applications by providing features like SSL termination, routing, and session affinity. Using Terraform, you can automate the provisioning and configuration of an Azure Application Gateway.

## Terraform Module for Azure Application Gateway

A Terraform module is a reusable and shareable configuration for defining and deploying Azure resources. To create an Azure Application Gateway using Terraform, you can use a pre-built module. This module simplifies the configuration process and allows you to create and manage an Application Gateway efficiently.

The terraform module supports following scenarios.

## Supported frontend IP configuration

For current general availability support, Application Gateway V2 supports the following combinations

- Private IP and Public IP
- Public IP only

## Supported Scenarios

The Terraform module for Azure Application Gateway is versatile and adaptable, accommodating various deployment scenarios. These scenarios dictate distinct input requirements. Here's an overview of the supported scenarios, each offering a unique configuration:

Each of these scenarios has its own set of input requirements, which can be tailored to meet your specific use case. The module provides the flexibility to deploy Azure Application Gateways for a wide range of applications and security needs.

**[Simple HTTP Application Gateway](examples/simple_http_host_single_site_app_gateway/README.md)**
This scenario sets up a straightforward HTTP Application Gateway, typically for basic web applications or services.

**[Multi-site HTTP Application Gateway](examples/simple_http_host_multiple_sites_app_gateway/README.md)** Multi-site hosting enables you to configure more than one web application on the same port of application gateways using public-facing listeners. It allows you to configure a more efficient topology for your deployments by adding up to 100+ websites to one application gateway. Each website can be directed to its own backend pool. For example, three domains, contoso.com, fabrikam.com, and adatum.com, point to the IP address of the application gateway. You'd create three multi-site listeners and configure each listener for the respective port and protocol setting.

**[Application Gateway Internal](examples/simple_http_app_gateway_internal/README.md)**
Azure Application Gateway Standard v2 can be configured with an Internet-facing VIP or with an internal endpoint that isn't exposed to the Internet. An internal endpoint uses a private IP address for the frontend, which is also known as an internal load balancer (ILB) endpoint.

**[Web Application Firewall (WAF)](examples/simple_waf_http_app_gateway/README.md)**
A Web Application Firewall is employed to enhance security by inspecting and filtering traffic. Configuration entails defining custom rules and policies to protect against common web application vulnerabilities.

**[Application Gateway with Self-Signed SSL (HTTPS)](examples/selfssl_waf_https_app_gateway/README.md)**
In this scenario, self-signed SSL certificates are utilized to secure traffic to HTTPS. You'll need to configure SSL certificates and redirection rules.

**[Application Gateway with SSL with Azure Key Vault](examples/kv_selfssl_waf_https_app_gateway/README.md)**
For enhanced security, SSL certificates are managed using Azure Key Vault. This scenario involves setting up Key Vault and integrating it with the Application Gateway. Detailed configuration for Key Vault and SSL certificates is necessary.

**[Application Gateway monitors the health probes](examples/simple_http_probe_app_gateway/README.md)**
Azure Application Gateway monitors the health of all the servers in its backend pool and automatically stops sending traffic to any server it considers unhealthy. The probes continue to monitor such an unhealthy server, and the gateway starts routing the traffic to it once again as soon as the probes detect it as healthy.

Before running the script, make sure you have logged in to your Azure subscription using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, so Terraform can authenticate and interact with your Azure account.

Please ensure that you have a clear plan and architecture for your Azure Application Gateway, as the Terraform script should align with your specific requirements and network design.
